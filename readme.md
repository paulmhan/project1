## Motivation:
The motivation behind developing this website was initially to make a health based recipe search; we wanted to help users eat mindfully by cooking at home, cognizant of all ingredients in their food. While doing so, why not help the user put the calories eaten from that meal (and all other meals from that day) into a log, and making sure they are within their daily calorie intake. 

The motivation behind the movies arised when we realized that a big reason many people go out to eat is for the social aspect; staying home on a weekend night can be considered boring. So by encouraging people to eat at home, we also decided to implement a movie search so people can enjoy a movie with their meal, thus giving them something to do and look forward to.
